# SHA256
OCaml Code for SHA256, extracted from Coq formalisation. 
Run 'make' in _CoqProject directory to generate the OCaml
file 'sha256.ml' and 'sha256.mli'. I have added the extracted 
code in the OCaml directory for an idea. You can control the 
extraction by changing the 'Extraction.v' file. Let me know
if you have any question.

I haven't done any optimisation but you can 
have a look at https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/V8.3/stdlib/Coq.extraction.ExtrOcamlZBigInt.html
